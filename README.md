Timer Clock (Python)

This is a very simple console-based timer program written in Python.
It takes hours, minutes, and seconds as input and then counts down one second at a time until the timer ends.
⚠️ This is my first ever Python project, so it’s intentionally basic and beginner-level.


📌 Features

Takes user input for:
Hours
Minutes
Seconds
Converts everything into total seconds
Counts down every second
Prints a message when time is up
Handles invalid (non-number) inputs using try/except


🧠 How It Works

The user enters hours, minutes, and seconds
These values are converted into total seconds
A loop counts down from that number to zero
The program waits 1 second between each count using time.sleep(1)
When the timer ends, it prints a final message


▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:
'python timerclock.py'
Follow the prompts and enter the time.

This project is made only for learning purposes.
I’m still learning Python, so the code may not be optimized or advanced — but everyone starts somewhere 💙
